    <h1 style="text-align: left; color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px;">Momo in Bhutan</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 17px;padding-top: 0%;">In Bhutan, momo is a popular and beloved dish, often enjoyed as a snack or meal. Bhutanese momos are typically filled with minced meat (commonly pork, beef, or chicken), cheese, or vegetables. What sets them apart is the generous use of local spices,
        garlic, ginger, and chili, giving them a flavorful and spicy taste that reflects Bhutanese cuisine. They are usually steamed but can also be fried or served with soup. Momos are commonly made at home during special occasions and are also widely
        available at restaurants and street stalls.
